The primary goal of this project was to showcase my skills in working with Material UI and React together. By combining these two powerful technologies, I was able to create a responsive and visually stunning application that seamlessly integrates user experience and functionality.

To optimize the performance of the application, I utilized React Query, a high-performance data fetching and caching library. This allowed for faster loading times and a smoother user experience overall.
